This report was prepared to the attention of the United Nations. It analyzes the relationship between a country's GDP, its life expecatncy and CO2 emissions. Our goal is to determine to what degree a country's economic strength or weakness may be related to its publichealth status and impact on climate pollution. We hypothesize tha both life expectancy and CO2 emissions increase with a country's GDP

```{r data}
gapminder_1997 <- read_csv("data/gapminder_1997.csv")
```
```{r gdp_lifeexp_1997, echo=FALSE}
ggplot(data = gapminder_1997) +
         aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp, color = continent, size =pop/1000000) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(x = "GDP Per Capita",
       y = "Life Expectancy",
       title = "Do people in wealthy countries live longer?",
       size = "Population (in millions)")
```


```{r include=FALSE}
nCountries <- gapminder_1997 %>%
  select(country) %>%
  n_distinct()

minGDP <- gapminder_1997 %>%
  summarise(round(min(gdpPercap))) %>%
  pull()
  
maxGDP <- gapminder_1997 %>%
  summarise(round(max(gdpPercap))) %>%
  pull()

```



The above plot shows the relationship between GDP per capita and life expectancy for a total of `r nCountries` countries. For this set of countries, economic wealth ranges from a minimum of USD `r minGDP` to a maximum of `r maxGDP` per capita.

* as the first item, write the name of your currently favorite programming language in bold
* as the second item, write the name of a function you have so far found most useful in italics
* as the third item, write one thing you want to learn next on your programming journey in bold italics
* turn your bullet point list into a numbered list
* create a fourth list item and find an online guide and/or cheat sheet for basic Markdown syntax, write its name down here and hyperlink its url

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE
plot(pressure)
```
